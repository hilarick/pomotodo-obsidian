# Pomotodo for Obsidian

Plugin that displays a [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) in the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) status bar. 


## Use
Click the clock icon in the left ribbon panel to start. Click again to toggle pause.

All of these actions are available from the command pallete. You can also set a hotkey to quit the timer.

## Settings

You can change the duration of the pomodoro timer, breaks, and interval between long breaks, and toggle the end of timer sound and white noise.

Autostart timer allows you to toggle whether the next break or pomodoro start automatically after the next, or waits for you to start it. If disabled, you can specify a number of pomodoro-and-break cycles that run automatically (for instance, if you want to run two pomodoros and their corresponding breaks without stopping and then pause, enter 2).
